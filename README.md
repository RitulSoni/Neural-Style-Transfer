## Introduction
Welcome to this exciting project where the Neural-Style algorithm, developed by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge, comes to life. The intersection of technology and art, this Flask application applies stunning artistic styles to your images, leveraging the power of deep neural networks and the flexibility of PyTorch.

## Features
1. The application takes three images: the input image, the content image, and the style image.
2. Transforms the input image by applying the content of the content image and the style of the style image.
3. Intuitive Flask interface for easy exploration and experimentation of different artistic styles.
4. The ability to upload your own images, select the content and style you want, and generate a visually stunning output.

## Setup
**Requirements**
- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- PyTorch

Follow these steps to get the application running:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-style-flask-app.git
    ```
2. Change to the directory:
    ```shell
    cd neural-style-flask-app
    ```
3. Install the requirements:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Start the Flask server:
    ```shell
    flask run
    ```
## How to Use
1. Visit the web page served by Flask (default: http://localhost:5000).
2. Upload your input image, content image, and style image.
3. Click the 'Generate' button to start the transformation.
4. Wait a few moments while your new artistic image is being created.
5. Download or share your created masterpiece!
